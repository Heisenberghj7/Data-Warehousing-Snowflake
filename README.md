# Data-Warehousing-Snowflake
<p>This project involves the creation of a data warehouse using Snowflake, to analyze Labour Requirements data in France during the Covid-19 period in 2020. The data is loaded into Snowflake using SnowSQL and Snowflake internal stage, then transformed using dbt. The data transformation process involves cleaning, structuring, and aggregating the data to make it ready for analysis. Airflow is used to schedule the ETL pipeline, ensuring that data is regularly updated and available for analysis. Finally, PowerBI is used to create visualizations and dashboards that provide insights into labour requirements in France during the Covid-19 pandemic. The end result is a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for analyzing and visualizing labour requirements data in France during this unprecedented period.</p>
